- Shuoran Li, *Pengcheng Xie*, et al., /*\"Simulation of Interaction of Folded Waveguide Space Traveling Wave Tubes with Derivative-free NEWUOA Algorithm\"*/, 2021 7th International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC), 2021, pp. 1215-1219, doi: 10.1109/ICCC54389.2021.9674410. [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9674410 \[Link\]] \n
(This paper was mainly finished by Shuoran Li, who is an engineer in the 12th Research Institute of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Electronics_Technology_Group_Corporation China Electronics Technology Group Corporation], and they coauthored with me since I provided some help about NEWUOA to them. This is definitely an engineering paper, not a mathematical one. Experiments are done by Shuoran Li. :-D )\n
