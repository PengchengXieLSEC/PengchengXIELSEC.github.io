abstract = "The modern problems of optimization, estimation, signal processing, and image recognition deal with data of huge dimensions. It is important to develop effective methods and algorithms for such problems. An important idea is the construction of low-dimension approximations to large-scale data. One of the most popular methods for this purpose is the principal component analysis (PCA), which is, however, sensitive to outliers. There exist numerous robust versions of PCA, relying on sparsity ideas and ℓ1 techniques. The present paper offers another approach to robust PCA exploiting Huber’s functions and numerical implementation based on the Iterative Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) method."

title = "An alternating direction method with increasing penalty for stable principal component pursuit",
abstract = "The stable principal component pursuit (SPCP) is a non-smooth convex optimization problem, the solution of which enables one to reliably recover the low rank and sparse components of a data matrix which is corrupted by a dense noise matrix, even when only a fraction of data entries are observable. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for solving SPCP. The proposed algorithm is a modification of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) where we use an increasing sequence of penalty parameters instead of a fixed penalty. The algorithm is based on partial variable splitting and works directly with the non-smooth objective function. We show that both primal and dual iterate sequences converge under mild conditions on the sequence of penalty parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first convergence result for a variable penalty ADMM when penalties are not bounded, the objective function is non-smooth and its sub-differential is not uniformly bounded. Using partial variable splitting and adopting an increasing sequence of penalty multipliers, together, significantly reduce the number of iterations required to achieve feasibility in practice. Our preliminary computational tests show that the proposed algorithm works very well in practice, and outperforms ASALM, a state of the art ADMM algorithm for the SPCP problem with a constant penalty parameter.",

  volume={60},

  pages={2882-2898},
  abstract={Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a powerful matrix decomposition technique that approximates a nonnegative matrix by the product of two low-rank nonnegative matrix factors. It has been widely applied to signal processing, computer vision, and data mining. Traditional NMF solvers include the multiplicative update rule (MUR), the projected gradient method (PG), the projected nonnegative least squares (PNLS), and the active set method (AS). However, they suffer from one or some of the following three problems: slow convergence rate, numerical instability and nonconvergence. In this paper, we present a new efficient NeNMF solver to simultaneously overcome the aforementioned problems. It applies Nesterov's optimal gradient method to alternatively optimize one factor with another fixed. In particular, at each iteration round, the matrix factor is updated by using the PG method performed on a smartly chosen search point, where the step size is determined by the Lipschitz constant. Since NeNMF does not use the time consuming line search and converges optimally at rate in optimizing each matrix factor, it is superior to MUR and PG in terms of efficiency as well as approximation accuracy. Compared to PNLS and AS that suffer from numerical instability problem in the worst case, NeNMF overcomes this deficiency. In addition, NeNMF can be used to solve -norm, -norm and manifold regularized NMF with the optimal convergence rate. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show the efficiency of NeNMF for NMF and its variants comparing to representative NMF solvers. Extensive experiments on document clustering suggest the effectiveness of NeNMF.},

abstract = {A new paradigm, Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), for fitting a model to experimental data is introduced. RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing},

@article{Vaz2007,
	Abstract = {
In this paper we develop, analyze, and test a new algorithm for the global minimization of a function subject to simple bounds without the use of derivatives. The underlying algorithm is a pattern search method, more specifically a coordinate search method, which guarantees convergence to stationary points from arbitrary starting points. In the optional search phase of pattern search we apply a particle swarm scheme to globally explore the possible nonconvexity of the objective function. Our extensive numerical experiments showed that the resulting algorithm is highly competitive with other global optimization methods also based on function values.

	Abstract = { Quadratic models are of fundamental importance to the efficiency of many optimization algorithms when second derivatives of the objective function influence the required values of the variables. They may be constructed by interpolation to function values for suitable choices of the interpolation points. We consider the Lagrange functions of this technique, because they have some highly useful properties. In particular, they show whether a change to an interpolation point preserves nonsingularity of the interpolation equations, and they provide a bound on the error of the quadratic model. Further, they can be updated efficiently when an interpolation point is moved. These features are explained. Then it is shown that the error bound can control the adjustment of a trust region radius in a way that gives excellent convergence properties in an algorithm for unconstrained minimization calculations. Finally, a convenient procedure for generating the initial interpolation points is described. },

	Abstract = {Abstract. UOBYQA is a new algorithm for general unconstrained optimization calculations, that takes account of the curvature of the objective function, F say, by forming quadratic models by interpolation. Therefore, because no first derivatives are required, each model is defined by (n+1)(n+2) values of F, where n is the number of variables, and the interpolation points must have the property that no nonzero quadratic polynomial vanishes at all of them. A typical iteration of the algorithm generates a new vector of variables,  $\widetilde\{\underline\{x\}\}$t say, either by minimizing the quadratic model subject to a trust region bound, or by a procedure that should improve the accuracy of the model. Then usually F( $\widetilde\{\underline\{x\}\}$t) is obtained, and one of the interpolation points is replaced by  $\widetilde\{\underline\{x\}\}$t. Therefore the paper addresses the initial positions of the interpolation points, the adjustment of trust region radii, the calculation of  $\widetilde\{\underline\{x\}\}$t in the two cases that have been mentioned, and the selection of the point to be replaced. Further, UOBYQA works with the Lagrange functions of the interpolation equations explicitly, so their coefficients are updated when an interpolation point is moved. The Lagrange functions assist the procedure that improves the model, and also they provide an estimate of the error of the quadratic approximation to F, which allows the algorithm to achieve a fast rate of convergence. These features are discussed and a summary of the algorithm is given. Finally, a Fortran implementation of UOBYQA is applied to several choices of F, in order to investigate accuracy, robustness in the presence of rounding errors, the effects of first derivative discontinuities, and the amount of work. The numerical results are very promising for n20, but larger values are problematical, because the routine work of an iteration is of fourth order in the number of variables.},

	Abstract = {
This paper studies the     $$H^1$$  Sobolev seminorm of quadratic functions. The research is motivated by the least-norm interpolation that is widely used in derivative-free optimization. We express the     $$H^1$$  seminorm of a quadratic function explicitly in terms of the Hessian and the gradient when the underlying domain is a ball. The seminorm gives new insights into least-norm interpolation. It clarifies the analytical and geometrical meaning of the objective function in least-norm interpolation. We employ the seminorm to study the extended symmetric Broyden update proposed by Powell. Numerical results show that the new thoery helps improve the performance of the update. Apart from the theoretical results, we propose a new method of comparing derivative-free solvers, which is more convincing than merely counting the numbers of function evaluations.

abstract = {Abstract A multi-armed bandit is an experiment with the goal of accumulating rewards from a payoff distribution with unknown parameters that are to be learned sequentially. This article describes a heuristic for managing multi-armed bandits called randomized probability matching, which randomly allocates observations to arms according the Bayesian posterior probability that each arm is optimal. Advances in Bayesian computation have made randomized probability matching easy to apply to virtually any payoff distribution. This flexibility frees the experimenter to work with payoff distributions that correspond to certain classical experimental designs that have the potential to outperform methods that are ‘optimal’ in simpler contexts. I summarize the relationships between randomized probability matching and several related heuristics that have been used in the reinforcement learning literature.

 abstract = {The technique of iterative weighted linear regression can be used to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters with observations distributed according to some exponential family and systematic effects that can be made linear by a suitable transformation. A generalization of the analysis of variance is given for these models using log-likelihoods. These generalized linear models are illustrated by examples relating to four distributions; the Normal, Binomial (probit analysis, etc.), Poisson (contingency tables) and gamma (variance components). The implications of the approach in designing statistics courses are discussed.},

The simplex adapts itself to the local landscape, and contracts on to the final minimum. The method is shown to be effective and computationally compact. A procedure is given for the estimation of the Hessian matrix in the neighbourhood of the minimum, needed in statistical estimation problems.}",

To protect privacy, the true answer is perturbed by the addition of random noise generated according to a carefully chosen distribution, and this response, the true answer plus noise, is returned to the user.",
